Geothermal Engineering Ltd (GEL) is a leading developer in UK deep geothermal
power. GEL is currently focussed on locally sourced heat and power in Cornwall,
utilising geothermal plants to produce power from deep geothermal wells.

ACT Acoustics has been a key contributor to GELs noise management and control
plan at their United Downs Deep Geothermal Power site near to Redruth,
Cornwall.

United Downs Deep Geothermal Power is the UK's first geothermal electricity
project. When complete, the site will extract energy by cycling water through a
naturally hot reservoir and using the heated water to drive a turbine to
produce electricity and heat.

The site includes two deep directions wells, the deepest being over 3 miles
deep. ACT Acoustics has developed the noise monitoring plan has been create to
control noise during both the construction and in-use phases of the plant.
During construction we have provided GEL with Class 1, web-connected noise
monitoring equipment, an online portal for real time noise monitoring and an
email notifications system for providing noise warning levels when noise levels
are reaching their licenced limits.
